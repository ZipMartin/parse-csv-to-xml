# parse-csv-to-xml

This converts a csv file to one xml file per row. It's written for a very specific use case within Enfocus Switch and called from the command line element, but can be easily adapted. This script is dependent on "csv-parser", available here: https://github.com/mafintosh/csv-parser or from console: $ npm install csv-parser
